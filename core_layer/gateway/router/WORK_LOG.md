Issue ID: GB-GEL001-STRICT
Date: 2026-08-04
Severity: N/A
Problem: Flat canonical module `router.py` violated GEL-001 (Strict): one module = one package.
Cause: Foundation-Freeze migration left canonical code as flat group-level files.
Decision: Convert to package, preserve public import path via `__init__` re-export (Director Strict order; no API change, no code rewrite).
Implementation: git mv `router.py` -> `router/router.py`; added `__init__.py` re-exporting the public surface with `__all__`; added the 8-file standard doc set.
Validation: pyflakes/compileall/pytest/main.py green (per-layer, see Director Review).
Lessons Learned: Import-preserving and test-safe when `__init__` re-exports every externally-used name.
